# timbre-grower

A handful of directions in training a model on a target timbre, reconstructing that timbre, and then "growing" it up from individual sine waves. Initially used translation into mel-spectorgram and then attempted to grow the spectrogram as an image with neural cellular automata, but I eventually realized that any spectrogram is going to be too lossy for a nice reconstruction.
